# UpdateCheckerUpdatedVersion

Welcome to the new spigot update checker GitHub page! Feel free to use the UpdateChecker which is provided in this GitHub repo. 

We have also included a cool console util which can create colors, and other type of warning messages without much work.

All we ask is you do not remove the copyright from the classes, enjoy!
